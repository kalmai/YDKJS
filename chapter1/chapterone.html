    These are my Chapter 1 projects:</br>
    <script src="./javascripts.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

<body style="background-color:black; color: white;">
<div>
1.  Write a program to calculate the total price of your phone purchase. </br>
You will keep purchasing phones (hint: loop!) until you run out of money in your bank account. </br>
You'll also buy accessories for each phone as long as your purchase amount is below your mental spending threshold.</br>
<button onclick="phoneTotal()">click me!</button></br>
<div style="background-color:darkslategray;">money in bank account $350.00</br>
phone price $99.00 </br>
extras per phone $5.00 </br>
</div>
2.  After you've calculated your purchase amount, add in the tax, then print out the calculated purchase amount, properly
formatted.</br>
3.  Finally, check the amount against your bank account balance to see if you can afford it or not.</br>
4. You should set up some constants for the "tax rate," "phone price," "accessory price," and "spending threshold," as </br>
well as a variable for your "bank account balance.""</br>
5.  You should define functions for calculating the tax and for formatting the price with a "$" and rounding to two </br>
decimal places.</br>
<button onclick="phoneTax()">click me!</button></br>
<div style="background-color:darkslategray;">money in bank account $350.00</br>
    phone price $99.00 </br>
    extras per phone $5.00 </br>
    tax rate 8%</br>
    </div>
Bonus Challenge: Try to incorporate input into this program, perhaps with the prompt(..) covered in "Input" earlier. </br>
You may prompt the user for their bank account balance, for example. Have fun and be creative!</br>
<button onclick="phoneTTinput()">click me!</button></br>
<div style="background-color:darkslategray;">money in bank account determined by prompt</br>
    phone price $99.00 </br>
    extras per phone $5.00 </br>
    tax rate 8%</br>
